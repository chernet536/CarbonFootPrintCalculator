            <h1 id="title">Carbon Foot Print Tracker Application</h1>
            <p class="lead">A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases, specifically carbon dioxide and other carbon compounds, that are emitted directly or indirectly by an individual, organization, event, or product throughout its lifecycle. It is typically measured in units of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e)
                to account for the different global warming potentials of various greenhouse gases.</p>
            <h1 id="title">Why Tracking Carbon Foot Print Matters?</h1>
            <p class="lead">
                Tracking carbon emissions is essential for organizations for several reasons:

            </p><br />
            <p class="lead">
 
            <strong>Environmental Responsibility:</strong> By monitoring their carbon footprint, organizations can better understand their impact on the environment. This awareness often leads to initiatives aimed at reducing emissions, such as implementing energy-efficient practices or investing in renewable energy sources.
            </p><br />
            <p class="lead">
            <strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Many jurisdictions have regulations in place to limit greenhouse gas emissions. By tracking their carbon footprint, organizations can ensure they are compliant with these regulations and avoid potential fines or penalties 
            </p><br />
            <p class="lead">
            <strong>Cost Savings:</strong> Reducing carbon emissions often goes hand in hand with reducing energy consumption and waste. By tracking their carbon footprint and implementing measures to reduce it, organizations can lower their operating costs over time.
            </p><br />
            <p class="lead">
              <strong>Competitive Advantage:</strong> Consumers are increasingly concerned about environmental issues, and they are more likely to support companies that demonstrate a commitment to sustainability. By tracking and reducing their carbon footprint, organizations can differentiate themselves from competitors and attract environmentally conscious customers.
            </p><br />
            <p class="lead">
                <strong>Risk Management:</strong> Climate change poses significant risks to businesses, including supply chain disruptions, increased operational costs, and reputational damage. By tracking their carbon emissions and implementing strategies to mitigate them, organizations can better prepare for the potential impacts of climate change.
